# Data Analysis with IBM Cloud and Python

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to analyze and visualize business data using IBM Cloud services and Python. We explore the Iris dataset, applying machine learning models and data visualization techniques to extract actionable insights. The project content is organized as follows:

1. **[Project Content PDF](project_content.pdf)**: This PDF document provides a detailed overview of the project, including its objectives, design thinking process, development phases, selected dataset (Iris), and steps to set up an analysis environment in IBM Cloud. It also covers data analysis techniques and visualization methods, ultimately translating findings into valuable business insights.

2. **[Jupyter Notebook](analysis.ipynb)**: This Jupyter Notebook contains Python code for data analysis using the Iris dataset. It includes the implementation of machine learning models like the Decision Tree Classifier and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). The notebook also demonstrates data visualization using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.

3. **[Iris Dataset (iris.csv)](iris.csv)**: This CSV file contains the Iris dataset, which is essential for the Jupyter Notebook (analysis.ipynb) to read and obtain data. The dataset consists of measurements of three different species of iris flowers.

## Usage

To replicate and explore the analysis:

1. Download the project content PDF (project_content.pdf) to understand the project's objectives and steps.

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook (analysis.ipynb) in your Jupyter environment. You can run the code cells to perform data analysis and visualization.

3. Ensure you have the Iris dataset (iris.csv) in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook. This dataset is required for the notebook to access and analyze the data.
